# Project_1 - Housing Price Predictions
The following repository will be created for the fulfilment of Project 1 in the 7th week of the GW bootcamp.

## House Price Prediction
The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression, by leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn. This project provides an end-to-end solution for estimated house price.

## Project Overview
The "House Price Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. This prediction task is of great significance in real estate and finance, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By employing Linear Regression and a curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for estimating house prices.

## Hypothesis
- If houses located in downtown areas, then they will generally  have higher prices compared to suburban areas .
- If the number of floors in a house increase, then the price will also increase .
- If the location of the house is determined, then the price will be affected
- If the number of bedroom relevant to the number of bathrooms increases, then the price of the house will increase
- If the house was built with a garage, then the price will increase

## Key Features
1. Objective: Predict house prices based on location, year built, and other property features
2. Data: Analyze housing data including Location, YearBuilt, and Price.
3. Grouping: Group data by Location and YearBuilt to find average prices.
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features like total rooms and property size to enhance prediction.
5. Model: Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using key features.
6. Prediction: Use the trained model to forecast house prices based on new property data.

## Conclusion
The houses located in Suburban area have higher prices than houses located in Downtown area. The price of the House is directly propotional to the numbers of floors in the house , there is a slight difference in price increase if the number of bedrooms and the bathrooms increase and the presence of garage does not affect the price of the house.
